Data, including frame relay data, is broken into packets containing 53 bytes each, which are switched between any two nodes in the system at rates ranging from 1.5 Mbps to 622 Mbps (over fiber optic cable). The basic unit of ATM transmission is known as a cell, a packet consisting of 5 bytes routing information and a 48-byte payload (data). These cells are transmitted to their destination, where they are reassembled into the original traffic. During transmission, cells from different users may be intermixed asynchronously to maximize utilization of network resources. ATM is defined in the broadband ISDN protocol at the levels corresponding to levels 1 and 2 of the ISO/OSI reference model. It is currently used in LANs (local area networks) involving workstations and personal computers, but it is expected to be adopted by the telephone companies, which will be able to charge customers for the data they transmit rather than for their connect time.

Each message on a baseband network travels as a packet that contains information about the source and destination machines as well as message data. Baseband networks operate over short distances at speeds ranging from about 50 kilobits per second (50 Kbps) to 16 megabits per second (16 Mbps). Receiving, verifying, and converting a message, however, add considerably to the actual time, reducing throughput.

The baud rate is the number of events, or signal changes, that occur in one second—not the number of bits per second (bps) transmitted. In high-speed digital communications, one event can actually encode more than one bit, and modems are more accurately described in terms of bits per second than baud rate. For example, a so-called 9600-baud modem actually operates at 2400 baud but transmits 9600 bits per second by encoding 4 bits per event (2400 x 4 = 9600) and thus is a 9600-bps modem.

Bell 212A governed modem operations at 1200 bps with full-duplex, asynchronous communications over dial-up telephone lines using phaseshift keying (PSK). An international set of transmission standards, known as the CCITT recommendations, has become generally accepted as the primary source of standardization, especially for communications at speeds greater than 1200 bps.

Benchmarks for software determine the efficiency, accuracy, or speed of a program in performing a particular task, such as recalculating data in a spreadsheet. The same data is used with each program tested, so the resulting scores can be compared to see which programs perform well and in what areas. The design of fair benchmarks is something of an art, because various combinations of hardware and software can exhibit widely variable performance under different conditions. Often, after a benchmark has become a standard, developers try to optimize a product to run that benchmark faster than similar products run it in order to enhance sales.

In graphics display and animation, a programming technique that manipulates blocks of bits in memory that represent the color and other attributes of a rectangular block of pixels forming a screen image. The image described can range in size from a cursor to a cartoon. Such a bit block is moved through a computer’s video RAM as a unit so that its pixels can be rapidly displayed in a desired location on the screen. The bits can also be altered; for example, light and dark portions of an image can be reversed. Successive displays can thus be used to change the appearance of an image or to move it around on the screen. Some computers contain special graphics hardware for manipulating bit blocks on the screen independently of the contents of the rest of the screen. This speeds the animation of small shapes, because a program need not constantly compare and redraw the background around the moving shape. Also called: bitblt. See also sprite."

These sections of memory are called bit planes because they are treated as if they were separate layers that stack one upon another to form the complete image. By contrast, in a chunky pixel image, the bits describing a given pixel are stored contiguously within the same byte. The use of bit planes to represent colors is often associated with the use of a color look-up table, or color map, which is used to assign colors to particular bit patterns. Bit planes are used in the EGA and VGA in 16-color graphics modes; the four planes correspond to the 4 bits of the IRGB code. See also color lookup table, color map, EGA, IRGB, layering, VGA.

An algebra, fundamental to computer operations but developed in the mid-nineteenth century by English mathematician George Boole, for determining whether logical propositions are true or false rather than for determining the values of numerical expressions. In Boolean algebra, variables must have one of only two possible values, true or false, and relationships between these variables are expressed with logical operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT. Given these two-state variables and the relationships they can have to one another, Boolean algebra produces such propositions as C = A AND B, which means that C is true if and only if both A is true and B is true; thus, it can be used to process information and to solve problems. Furthermore, Boolean logic can be readily applied to the electronic circuitry used in digital computing. Like the binary numbers 1 and 0, true and false are easily represented by two contrasting physical states of a circuit, such as voltages, and computer circuits known as logic gates control the flow of electricity (bits of data) so as to represent AND, OR, NOT, and other Boolean operators. Within a computer, these logic gates are combined, with the output from one becoming the input to another so that the final result (still nothing more than sets of 1s and 0s) is meaningful data, such as the sum of two numbers.

Brute-force programming also ignores available information on how similar situations were handled in the past and might depend on outmoded design methodologies. For example, a program using brute force to crack passwords might try all the words in a dictionary (which would require huge amounts of computing power).

It repeats the process with the node indicated by the corresponding link. At the lowest level, the links indicate the data records.

More severe bugs can require the user to restart the program or the computer, losing whatever previous work had not been saved. Worse yet are bugs that damage saved data without alerting the user. All such errors must be found and corrected by the process known as debugging. Because of the potential risk to important data, commercial application programs are tested and debugged as completely as possible before release. After the program becomes available, further minor bugs are corrected in the next update. A more severe bug can sometimes be fixed with a piece of software called a patch, which circumvents the problem or in some other way alleviates its effects.

For example, various communications devices (as on networks) can send data in bursts, and the speed of such equipment is sometimes measured as the burst speed (the speed of data transfer while the burst is being executed). Also called: burst rate. 2. The number of characters per second that a printer can print on one line without a carriage return or linefeed. Burst speed measures the actual speed of printing, without consideration of the time taken to advance paper or to move the print head back to the left margin. Almost always, the speed claimed by the manufacturer is the burst speed. By contrast, throughput is the number of characters per second when one or more entire pages of text are being printed and is a more practical measurement of printer speed in real-life situations."

      "title": "bus ",
      "description": "n. A set of hardware lines (conductors) used for data transfer among the components of a computer system. A bus is essentially a shared highway that connects different parts of the system—including the processor, disk-drive controller, memory, and input/output ports—and enables them to transfer information. The bus consists of specialized groups of lines that carry different types of information. One group of lines carries data; another carries memory addresses (locations) where data items are to be found; yet another carries control signals. Buses are characterized by the number of bits they can transfer at a single time, equivalent to the number of wires within the bus. A computer with a 32-bit address bus and a 16-bit data bus, for example, can transfer 16 bits of data at a time from any of 2^32 memory locations. Most PCs contain one or more expansion slots into which additional boards can be plugged to connect them to the bus."

C is a compiled language that contains a small set of built-in functions that are machine dependent. The rest of the C functions are machine independent and are contained in libraries that can be accessed from C programs.

The cellular automaton is composed of a network of multiple cells, each representing a processor in the parallel computer. The cells must be identical, and they must have a finite amount of available memory. Each cell outputs a value calculated from the input values it receives from its neighboring cells, and all cells output their values simultaneously. 2. Systems in which rules are applied to multiple cells and their neighbors in a regular spatial lattice or grid that advances through time. Usually, each cell in a cellular automaton has any one state out of a finite number of states. The state changes discretely in time according to rules that depend on the condition of the individual cell and its neighbors. Thus, an individual cell in a cellular automaton takes a neighbor cell’s state as input before outputting its own state. Additionally, all the cells in the lattice are updated simultaneously, while the state of the entire lattice also advances discretely in time. Many computer simulations of cellular automata are demonstrated on Web sites; the best known Web example is J.H. Conway’s Game of Life."

Communication between the CGI script and the server is carried out via the CGI specification. CGI scripts can be written in many programming languages, including C, C++, and Visual Basic. However, the most commonly used language for CGI scripts is Perl because it is a small but robust language and it is common on UNIX, which is the platform on which the majority of Web sites run. CGI scripts don’t necessarily need to be scripts; they can also be batch programs or compiled programs. CGI scripts are used to provide interactivity on a Web page, including such features as providing a form that users can fill out, image maps that contain links to other Web pages or resources, and links that users can click on to send e-mail to a specified address. ActiveX controls and Java applets can provide much the same functionality as CGI scripts, through different means. See also CGI (definition 1), cgi-bin, image map, Perl.

It is based on a three-tiered model based on schemas—sets of classes: the Core Schema covers all areas of management; Common Schemas cover specific management areas, such as networks, applications, and devices; and Extension Schemas cover specific technologies, such as operating systems and applications. CIM is supported by a number of industry vendors, including Sun, IBM, Microsoft, and Cisco. See also DMTF, WBEM. 2. Acronym for computer-integrated manufacturing. The use of computers, communication lines, and specialized software to automate both the managerial functions and the operational activities involved in the manufacturing process.

      "description": "n. 1. In object-oriented programming, a generalized category that describes a group of more specific items, called objects, that can exist within it. A class is a descriptive tool used in a program to define a set of attributes or a set of services (actions available to other parts of the program) that characterize any member (object) of the class. Program classes are comparable in concept to the categories that people use to organize information about their world, such as animal, vegetable, and mineral, that define the types of entities they include and the ways those entities behave. The definition of classes in object-oriented programming is comparable to the definition of types in languages such as C and Pascal. See also object-oriented programming. 2. For hardware, the method for grouping particular types of devices and buses according to the basic ways that they can be installed and managed by the operating system. The hardware tree is organized by device class, and Windows uses class installers to install drivers for all hardware classes."

The server component can be a personal computer, a minicomputer, or a mainframe that provides the traditional strengths offered by minicomputers and mainframes in a time-sharing environment: data management, information sharing between clients, and sophisticated network administration and security features. The client and server machines work together to accomplish the processing of the application being used. Not only does this increase the processing power available over older architectures but it also uses that power more efficiently.

The worm maintains a list of all computers previously infected, and all these computers will be attacked each month by every newly infected machine. This makes total eradication of the worm difficult because a single machine remaining infected from earlier propagation/attack cycles can potentially re-infect every machine on the list, and each computer might be subject to multiple attacks.

In computer video, color is produced by a combination of hardware and software. Software manipulates combinations of bits that represent the distinct shades of color that are destined for particular positions on the screen (characters or individual dots, called pixels). The video adapter hardware translates these bits into electrical signals, which in turn control the brightnesses of differentcolored phosphors at the corresponding positions on the screen of the monitor CRT.

Compatibility (or the lack thereof) between two machines indicates whether, and to what degree, the computers can communicate, share data, or run the same programs. For example, an Apple Macintosh and an IBM PC are generally incompatible because they cannot communicate freely or share data without the aid of hardware and/ or software that functions as an intermediary or a converterconverter. 3. The extent to which a piece of hardware conforms to an accepted standard (for example, IBMcompatible or Hayes-compatible). In this sense, compatibility means that the hardware ideally operates in all respects like the standard on which it is based. 4. In reference to software, harmony on a task-oriented level among computers and computer programs. Computers deemed software-compatible are those that can run programs originally designed for other makes or models. Software compatibility also refers to the extent to which programs can work together and share data. In another area, totally different programs, such as a word processor and a drawing program, are compatible with one another if each can incorporate images or files created using the other.

A composite display signal carries on one wire not only the coded information required to form an image on the screen but also the pulses needed to synchronize horizontal and vertical scanning as the electron beam sweeps back and forth across the screen. Composite displays can be either monochrome or color. A composite color signal combines the three primary video colors (red, green, and blue) in a color burst component that determines the shade of color displayed on the screen. Composite color monitors are less readable than either monochrome monitors or the RGB color monitors that use separate signals (and wires) for the red, green, and blue components of the image.

If defined as the number of instructions the machine can carry out in a given time, computer power is measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPS) or millions of floating-point operations per second (MFLOPS). Power is measured in other ways too, depending on the needs or objectives of the person evaluating the machine. By users or purchasers of computers, power is often considered in terms of the machine’s amount of random access memory (RAM), the speed at which the processor works, or the number of bits (8, 16, 32, and so on) handled by the computer at one time. Other factors enter into such an evaluation, however; two of the most important are how well the components of the computer work together and how well they are matched to the tasks required of them. For example, no matter how fast or powerful the computer, its speed will be hampered during operations involving the hard disk if the hard disk is slow (for example, with an access time of 65 milliseconds or higher).

Registration of a copyright, or the use of a copyright symbol, is not needed to create the copyright but does strengthen the originator’s legal powers. Unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted material can lead to severe penalties, whether done for profit or not. Copyrights affect the computer community in three ways: the copyright protection of software, the copyright status of material (such as song lyrics) distributed over a network such as the Internet, and the copyright status of original material distributed over a network (such as a newsgroup post). The latter two involve electronic media that are arguably not tangible, and legislation protecting the information disseminated through electronic media is still evolving.

The numbers in the cyclic binary system represent a code, much like Morse code, whereas “plain” binary numbers represent actual values in the binary number system. Because sequential numbers differ by only 1 bit, cyclic binary is used to minimize errors in representing unit measurements. See the table. "

However, device drivers associated with application packages typically perform only the data translation; these higher-level drivers then rely on lower-level drivers to actually send the data to the device. Many devices, especially video adapters on PC-compatible computers, will not work properly—if at all—without the correct device drivers installed in the system."

A digital video disc can store greater amounts of data than a traditional CD. A standard singlelayer, single-sided digital video disc can store 4.7 GB of data; a two-layer standard increases the single-sided disc capacity to 8.5 GB. Digital video discs can be doublesided with a maximum storage of 17 GB per disc. A digital video disc player is needed to read digital video discs; this player is equipped to read older optical storage technologies. Advocates of the digital video disc intend to replace current digital storage formats, such as laser disc, CD-ROM, and audio CD, with the single digital format of the digital video disc.

The companies—AST Research, Compaq, Epson, Hewlett-Packard, NEC, Olivetti, Tandy, Wyse, and Zenith—were referred to collectively as “the Gang of Nine.” EISA maintains compatibility with the earlier Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) but provides for additional features introduced by IBM in its Micro Channel Architecture bus standard. EISA has a 32-bit data path, and it uses connectors that can accept ISA cards. However, EISA cards are compatible only with EISA systems. EISA can operate at much higher frequencies than the ISA bus and provides much faster data throughput than ISA. See also ISA, Micro Channel Architecture."

In times past, programs were required to interrogate, and effectively anticipate, every device that was expected to interact with the program, such as the keyboard, mouse, printer, disk drive, and serial port. Often, unless sophisticated programming techniques were used, one of two events happening at the same instant would be lost. Event processing solves this problem through the creation and maintenance of an event queue. Most common events that occur are appended to the event queue for the program to process in turn; however, certain types of events can preempt others if they have a higher priority. An event can be of several types, depending on the specific operating system considered: pressing a mouse button or keyboard key, inserting a disk, clicking on a window, or receiving information from a device driver (as for managing the transfer of data from the serial port or from a network connection).

This core is surrounded by a refractive layer called the cladding that effectively traps the light and keeps it bouncing along the central fiber. Outside both the core and the cladding is a final layer of plastic or plastic-like material called the coat, or jacket. Fiberoptic cable can transmit clean signals at speeds as high as 2 Gbps.

Fibonacci numbers are named for the thirteenth- century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa. In computing, Fibonacci numbers are used to speed binary searches by repeatedly dividing a set of data into groups in accordance with successively smaller pairs of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, a data set of 34 items would be divided into one group of 21 and another of 13. If the item being sought is in the group of 13, the group of 21 is discarded, and the group of 13 is divided into groups of 5 and 8; the search would continue until the item was located. The ratio of two successive terms in the Fibonacci sequence converges on the Golden Ratio, a “magic number” that seems to represent the proportions of an ideal rectangle. The number describes many things, from the curve of a nautilus shell to the proportions of playing cards or, intentionally, the Parthenon, in Athens, Greece. See also binary search."

Computer graphics technicians often use fractals to generate naturelike images such as landscapes, clouds, and forests. The distinguishing characteristic of fractals is that they are “self-similar”; any piece of a fractal, when magnified, has the same character as the whole. The standard analogy is that of a coastline, which has a similar structure whether viewed on a local or continental scale. Interestingly, it is often difficult to measure the length of the perimeter of such a shape exactly because the total distance measured depends on the size of the smallest element measured. For example, one could measure on a given coastline the perimeter of every peninsula and inlet, or at a higher magnification the perimeter of every small promontory and jetty, and so on. In fact, a given fractal may have a finite area but an infinite perimeter; such shapes are considered to have a fractional dimension—for example, between 1 (a line) and 2 (a plane)—hence the name fractal.

HTML 2, defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), included features of HTML common to all Web browsers as of 1994 and was the first version of HTML widely used on the World Wide Web. HTML+ was proposed for extending HTML 2 in 1994, but it was never implemented. HTML 3, which also was never standardized or fully implemented by a major browser developer, introduced tables. HTML 3.2 incorporated features widely implemented as of early 1996, including tables, applets, and the ability to flow text around images. HTML 4, the latest specification, supports style sheets and scripting languages and includes internationalization and accessibility features. Future HTML development will be carried out by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

In interlace scanning the electron beam in the television or monitor refreshes alternate sets of scan lines in successive top-tobottom sweeps, refreshing all even lines on one pass, and all odd lines on the other. Because of the screen phosphor’s ability to maintain an image for a short time before fading and the tendency of the human eye to average or blend subtle differences in light intensity, the human viewer sees a complete display, but the amount of information carried by the display signal and the number of lines that must be displayed per sweep are halved. Interlaced images are not as clear as those produced by the progressive scanning typical of newer computer monitors. Interlace scanning is, however, the standard method of displaying analog broadcast television images. Also called: interlacing. Compare progressive scanning."

The first is through a dialing up of an Internet service provider or an online information services provider via a modem connected to the user’s computer. This method is the one used by the majority of home computer users. The second way is through a dedicated line, such as a T1 carrier, that is connected to a local area network, to which, in turn, the user’s computer is connected. The dedicated line solution is used by larger organizations, such as corporations, which either have their own node on the Internet or connect to an Internet service provider that is a node. A third way that is emerging is for users to use set-top boxes with their TVs. Generally, however, this will give a user access only to documents on the World Wide Web.

Interrupts can be generated by various hardware devices to request service or report problems, or by the processor itself in response to program errors or requests for operating-system services. Interrupts are the processor’s way of communicating with the other elements that make up a computer system. A hierarchy of interrupt priorities determines which interrupt request will be handled first if more than one request is made. A program can temporarily disable some interrupts if it needs the full attention of the processor to complete a particular task.

      "description": "n. An electrophotographic printer that is based on the technology used by photocopiers. A focused laser beam and a rotating mirror are used to draw an image of the desired page on a photosensitive drum. This image is converted on the drum into an electrostatic charge, which attracts and holds toner. A piece of electrostatically charged paper is rolled against the drum, which pulls the toner away from the drum and onto the paper. Heat is then applied to fuse the toner to the paper. Finally, the electrical charge is removed from the drum, and the excess toner is collected. By omitting the final step and repeating only the toner-application and paper-handling steps, the printer can make multiple copies. The only serious drawback of a laser printer is that it offers less paper-handling flexibility than do dot-matrix printers. Both multipart forms and wide-carriage printing, for example, are better handled by line printers or dot-matrix printers. See also electrophoto-graphic printers, nonimpact printer, page printer.

The “last mile” connection historically has referred to the twisted-pair copper wires used between a home and the telephone company. While this definition remains accurate, “last mile” is now often used more broadly to refer to the link between an end user’s system and the high-speed Internet access technology of a service provider, such as an ISP (Internet service provider). Thus, for modem users accessing the Internet through voice-grade lines, the last mile is still equivalent to the phone company’s twistedpair copper wiring. However, because standard modem transmission over voice-grade lines is sometimes frustratingly slow, other last mile solutions have been designed to provide greater speed and bandwidth. These include coaxial cable (used in cable TV), fiber optics, or a radio link (such as a cellular telephone or a point-to-point link).

When the key code is typed or the macro name is used, the program carries out the instructions of the macro. Users can create a macro to save time by replacing an often-used, sometimes lengthy, series of strokes with a shorter version. 2. In programming languages, such as C or assembly language, a name that defines a set of instructions that are substituted for the macro name wherever the name appears in a program (a process called macro expansion) when the program is compiled or assembled. Macros are similar to functions in that they can take arguments and in that they are calls to lengthier sets of instructions. Unlike functions, macros are replaced by the actual instructions they represent when the program is prepared for execution; function instructions are copied into a program only once. Compare function (definition 2)."

These procedures include selectively storing data, monitoring it carefully, and freeing memory when the data is no longer needed. Most current operating systems optimize RAM usage on their own; some older operating systems, such as early versions of MS-DOS, required the use of third-party utilities to optimize RAM usage and necessitated that the user be more knowledgeable about how the operating system and applications used memory. See also memory management unit, RAM. 2. In programming, the process of ensuring that a program releases each chunk of memory when it is no longer needed. In some languages, such as C and C++, the programmer must keep track of memory usage by the program. Java, a newer language, automatically frees any chunk of memory that is not in use.
